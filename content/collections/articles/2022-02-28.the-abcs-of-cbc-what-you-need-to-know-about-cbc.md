THE ABCs OF CBC: What you need to know about CBC.
The rollout of the new education system in Kenya, Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) has been controversial among many parents and teachers who arguably claim that its launch has been a burden. Experts on the contrary insist that it presented a lesser burden compared to the 8-4-4 system that is phasing out. CBC requires full Parental engagement which means active participation by the parent in their child’s education, which has proved to be a challenge as most parents do not have sufficient information on the curriculum.
The new education system in Kenya was introduced in 2017 to replace the 8-4-4 education system. It was researched and developed by the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD). Kenya’s initial education system was 7-4-2-3, a formal education system introduced by colonial rule in 1963. It consisted of; seven years in primary school, four years in lower secondary school, two years in upper secondary school, and a minimum of three years in university education. This system was then replaced by the 8-4-4 system in 1985, consisting of; eight years in primary school, four years in secondary school, and four years in university education. CBC consists of 2-6-3-3-3, meaning; two years in pre-primary education, six years in primary education, three years in junior secondary education, three years in senior secondary education, and three years in university education.

Some of the features of CBC that stand out that we should be aware of are that;  
CBC is outcome-based and learning is geared towards the achievement of the set skills/competencies.
Learner-Centered means it is engaging and the focus of learning is the learner.
CBC learning is adjusted to meet the individual needs of specific learners.
 
CBC comes with its own assessment system, Competency-Based Assessment (CBA), whereby a student’s competency is pinned against previously set standards of performance. This is unlike formal exams, as involving a set of methodical processes that collects evidence to assist analyze learners’ progress and achievements. It involves the learners performing certain tasks and the teachers developing further learning activities to help cover any gaps identified until the pupil becomes proficient. Teachers keep and build on individual learners’ data on skills and weaknesses based on these assessments. The information is then fed to the students’ end-of-term report and informs teachers, parents, and guardians of the pupil’s termly efforts, growth, and achievements.
The new curriculum was designed to align with Vision 2030 to assist Kenya’s economy to grow and society prosper. It seeks to develop empowered and ethical citizens that are creative, able to think for themselves, have 21st-century skills. The Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) focuses on the acquisition of the desired knowledge skills, values, and attitudes to enable the learner to cope with life challenges. It also focuses on the achievement of learning outcomes in terms of the desired behavioral change. Seven Core Competencies are intended to help learners fulfill their potential both in school and in life, they are communication and collaboration, self-efficacy, critical thinking and problem solving, creativity and imagination, citizenship, digital literacy, and learning to learn.
