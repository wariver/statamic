When we come together, great things happen. We share experiences, have amazing conversations, and learn from one another. That is what went down at Nakuru County, when Kurasa Africa, together with Dr. Julius Otundo, a renowned education expert, joined Directors and Head Teachers from different schools in Nakuru County, at Kagaki Primary School, to not only learn but also share a platform of knowledge.

Kurasa Africa is the leading number one organization, a Kenyan-based EdTech startup that supports k-12 schools towards improving pedagogical experiences for better academic outcomes. We have built a tool to reduce assessment cycle time. The tool enables teachers to perform assessments on learning areas and reports delivered to guardians in real time. This visibility empowers teachers and guardians to introduce necessary interventions and measure learning improvement.

At a time when our Country is at crossroads on whether to do away with Competency Based Curriculum, and retain the older 8-4-4 system, it takes bold minds to stand in the gap and help stakeholders not only understand the need for curriculum reforms, but also bring together educationists, researchers, and stakeholders to collaboratively identify what aspects of both curriculums are useful in informing changes. 
Kurasa Africa runs capacity-building workshops countrywide for Kurasa Alliance member schools, which are facilitated to help them better implement and monitor CBC in the classrooms. School leaders and teachers need the knowledge and tools, to enable them to offer the most to learners. 

We look forward to more County Engagements with all educators, in a bid to make contributions geared toward improving our education system.
